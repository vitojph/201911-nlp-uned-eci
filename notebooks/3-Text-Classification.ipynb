    "# The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to automatically detect when a message or a comment published online contains _toxic_ language, ie. when people show some kind of verbal abuse and harassment online.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we tackle this?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary classification** is the classification task with just two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - true vs false\n",
    "    - spam vs ham\n",
    "    - cat vs not cat\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-class classification** means a classification task with more than two classes, each label being mutually exclusive. The classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - polarity in sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative)\n",
    "    - named entity recognition (person, organization, location, misc)\n",
    "    - our macros classifier (20-something classes, mutally exclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-label classification** assigns to each sample a set of target labels. This can be thought as predicting properties of a data-point that are not mutually exclusive\n",
    "\n",
    "    - classifying movies into one or more genre(s)\n",
    "    - generating automatic captions for an image\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a programming paradigm consisting of making systems learn from experience: we teach the computer to perform a task by recognizing patterns out of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice this is important in terms of not re-inventing the wheel, since the same code (indeed, the same learning mechanism) can be used to learn different tasks (eg. analyze sentiment analysis or identify traffic lights).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically two types of ML approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Supervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning): the data is labeled. You tell the system how to categorize the example. Given an input, the system learns how to map it to an output. The system learns to generalize and detect which inputs predict an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Unsupervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning): no labels. The system is forced to figure out its own labels that better classify the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll always want to try supervised algorithms, because they perform better. A (useful) labeled dataset is a rare resource because it's expensive to create. The best datasets are manually crafted, carefully annotated and reviewed but different people in order to remove biases and to maximize the inter-annotator agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other sub-types of ML approaches: [semi-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning), [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), and [generative adversarial networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# What Do We Need Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ML implies the system learns by example, we need to provide the system a collection of examples: a dataset. In this particular case, we need a (BIG\\*) collection of labeled online messages or comments containing both toxic language (referred as **positive examples**) and non-toxic language (called **negative examples**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we can create our own dataset. We can try to collect online messaging and anotate them by hand. And some times, that's what we'll need to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## You said *big*. How big is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Size matters, for sure. The bigger, the better. It's impossible to state a clear number, and it depends on the task. But for text classification tasks, you will tipically need examples in the order of tens of thousands. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the collection is not the only requirement. It's also important to have a dataset representative enough and with the same distribution of data than the problem you want to solve. It's also important to remove or minimize any possible biases of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exploring the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we don't need to collect and annotate any set of online comments. Instead, we'll be using a public dataset, the [Jigsaw's Toxic Comments](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge), a collection of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a classifier able to assign these labels to a new message and thus detect wheter it constains toxic language or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load the dataset and take a look at the data."
